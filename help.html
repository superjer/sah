<p>Play in person, or use voice chat!</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click the <i>Draw</i> button to draw cards.</li>
  <li>Play white cards in the top row to match blanks in the black card.</li>
  <li>If you are the Czar, wait for the other players to play enough cards and then <i>Call it</i>.</li>
  <li>As the Czar, pick your favorite submission.</li>
  <li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Full Rules</h2>
<h3>On Your Turn</h3>
<p>On each turn, you will be the Czar, or a regular player. The current Czar is shown in the score grid on the right.</p>
<p>If you are the Czar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read aloud the text of the black card, so everyone can hear it. It is important that everyone hears how you read the card, as it makes it easier to select white cards. Seriously, this is important. Just do it.</li>
  <li>Wait for everyone to play a card. If someone can't or won't play, you can click <i>Call it</i> to skip them. You can also wait out the timer if you are afraid of clicking the button.</li>
  <li>You can see how many cards each player has in play in the <i>Card</i> column in the score grid.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are not the Czar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Play white cards in the top row to match the blanks in the black card. Each black card indicates the number of white cards it will consume with the text <i>Play 1</i>, <i>Play 2</i> or <i>Play 3</i>. If there are multiple blanks on a <i>Play 1</i>, then the same white card will appear in every blank.</li>
  <li>Putting extra cards in the top row has no ill effect. Cards will be consumed from the left to the right as needed.</li>
  <li>If you don't play enough cards, and the round is called, you will be skipped.</li>
  <li>Order is important! The order of your white cards will match up to the order of the blanks on the black card.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Calling It</h3>
<p>The round can be <i>called</i> when there are at least 2 submissions in play, and at least 10 seconds have elapsed.</p>
<p>The Czar can <i>call it</i> by clicking the <i>Call it</i> button, or the game will be called automatically when the time limit is reached. The default round time is 180 seconds. If playing in-person it is advisable to set a very long round time.</p>

<h3>Select the Winner</h3>
<p>The Czar may now click on each submission to reveal it to everyone. For each submission, the Czar <i>MUST</i> read aloud the black card with the white card text inserted. It isn't a race! Often the white cards will be less funny without the vocalized context of the black card. Just be a good sport and read with context.</p>
<p>It is entirely up to the Czar to choose the favorite submission. There are absolutely no rules as to how the Czar decides. The Czar can choose the funniest, cleverest, most true, most false, or just a random winner. It is up to each player to try to please the Czar with his or her submission.</p>
<p>The submissions are anonymous. Please note it is very poor sportsmanship to hint to the Czar which submission is yours.</p>

<h3>Abandoning the Round</h3>
<p>It is possible that the Czar may take too long or leave the game without selecting a winner. If you don't think the Czar is coming back, click the Abandon button to vote to abandon the round, so that the game can continue.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If all active players vote to abandon, the round is abandoned immediately.</li>
  <li>If at least two active players have voted to abandon, and the time limit is reached, the round is abandoned. The default abandon time is 180 seconds.</li>
  <li>If at least two inactive players (players who did not play a card this round) have voted to abandon, and twice the time limit is reached, the round is abandoned. This is to handle the very odd but not impossible case that the Czar and say, the only two active players have all wandered off.</li>
  <li>When the round is abandoned, no one gets a point and everyone gets their white cards returned to them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Czar Selection</h3>
<p>Determining the Czar is a complex process because players are allowed to drop in and out of the game at any time. It is further complicated by the fact that players can go idle by not playing any cards for a round or more. In the interest of avoiding having to use the abandon mechanic, idle players are not eligible to become the Czar.</p>
<p>The computer selects the new Czar by choosing the active player who was least recently the Czar previously. </p>
<p>For the purposes of this process, new players are considered to have been the Czar right before the current Czar at the time they joined. In other words, if you join a game, you will be the Czar after seeing everyone else be the Czar once.</p>

<h3>Game Over</h3>
<p>When any player gets enough points to match the goal score, the game is over. The default goal score is 11 points. If the winning player won by cheating, it will be noted in the game-over screen.</p>

<h3>Leaving the Game</h3>
<p>Click the <i>Exit</i> button to return to the lobby. Exiting the game forfeits your points. If you re-join you will have zero points.</p>
<p>Feel free to refresh or navigate away from the game and back in your browser. It will not adversely affect the game. You can only leave the game by clicking the <i>Exit</i> button.</p>
